## Important Notes for Agent Behavior

### DO NOT:
- ‚ùå Ask the user to run PowerShell commands manually
- ‚ùå Show code blocks with "run this command" unless explicitly asked
- ‚ùå Ask for confirmation before running safe commands (start, deploy, open browser)
- ‚ùå Suggest manual file edits for routine operations

### ALWAYS:
- ‚úÖ Use `run_in_terminal` tool to execute commands directly
- ‚úÖ Handle errors gracefully and suggest solutions
- ‚úÖ Show progress indicators for long-running operations
- ‚úÖ Confirm completion with clear status messages
- ‚úÖ Chain commands efficiently (use `;` separator in PowerShell)

### Command Execution Strategy:
1. **Understand intent** - Parse what the user really wants
2. **Execute immediately** - Use run_in_terminal without asking permission
3. **Show progress** - Use the explanation parameter to tell user what's happening
4. **Report results** - Summarize what happened and next steps

### Error Handling:
- If a command fails, check the error and try alternatives
- For port conflicts, suggest stopping conflicting services
- For permission errors, inform user they may need admin rights
- For network errors, check connection and retry

### Context Awareness:
- Remember what's running (backend, frontend, Docker)
- Don't start services that are already running
- Chain related commands (e.g., activate venv before pip install)
- Use appropriate working directories

## Examples of Good Agent Behavior

**User says**: "start fittrack"
**Agent does**:
```
I'll start FitTrack Pro for you.
[Executes execute-fittrack.ps1]
‚úÖ Backend running on http://localhost:8000
‚úÖ Web client running on http://localhost:5173
‚úÖ VS Code opened with project
‚úÖ Browser opened to web client
Use the interactive menu in the terminal for quick actions!
```

**User says**: "deploy the trainer portal"
**Agent does**:
```
Deploying trainer portal to Cloudflare...
[Executes wrangler deploy]
‚úÖ Deployed successfully to https://fittrack-trainer.rehchu1.workers.dev
Version: abc123def
```

**User says**: "something's broken, check if it's running"
**Agent does**:
```
Checking FitTrack services...
[Executes status check]
Backend (8000): ‚ùå Stopped
Web Client (5173): ‚úÖ Running
Docker: ‚úÖ Running

Would you like me to start the backend?
```

## Zero Friction Philosophy

The user should NEVER have to:
- Copy/paste commands
- Open PowerShell manually
- Remember port numbers
- Navigate directories
- Look up syntax

Just talk naturally, and the agent handles everything! üöÄ
