5. No AI-powered suggestions (Workers AI binding ready but unused)

### Recommended Enhancements (V1.2+)
1. **Enhanced Modals:** Replace prompts with rich HTML modals
2. **Photo Upload UI:** Drag-and-drop interface for progress photos
3. **Advanced Analytics:** Charts.js integration for trend graphs
4. **AI Integration:** Quest/meal/workout suggestions via Workers AI
5. **Email Notifications:** Resend.com integration for quest achievements
6. **Export Features:** PDF reports for clients
7. **Mobile App:** React Native client app (API-ready)
8. **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket support for live quest progress
9. **Bulk Operations:** Import/export clients, batch quest creation
10. **Custom Branding:** Trainer-specific themes and logos
