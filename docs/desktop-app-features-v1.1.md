## 💪 Feature 5: Workout/Meal Separation

### Implementation
- **Modified:** Workouts and Meals tabs in `ClientProfile.jsx`
- **Logic:** Filter by `assigned_by_trainer` flag

### Workouts Tab
**Trainer-Assigned Workouts** (Read-Only for Client)
- ✅ Created by trainer via "Assign New Workout"
- ✅ Displays scheduled date
- ✅ Yellow badge: "Trainer Plan"
- ✅ Client cannot edit or delete

**Client-Logged Workouts** (Client Can Add)
- ✅ Logged by client independently
- ✅ Green badge: "Client Logged"
- ✅ Trainer can view but not edit
- ✅ Shows completion date

### Meals Tab
**Trainer-Assigned Meal Plans** (Read-Only for Client)
- ✅ Created by trainer via "Assign New Meal Plan"
- ✅ Shows date and calories
- ✅ Yellow badge: "Trainer Plan"
- ✅ Nutritional guidance from professional

**Client-Logged Meals** (Client Can Add)
- ✅ Logged by client for tracking
- ✅ Green badge: "Client Logged"

### Benefits
1. **Accountability:** Trainer sees what client is actually doing
2. **Flexibility:** Client can log extra workouts/meals
3. **Clarity:** Clear distinction between assigned vs logged
4. **Compliance:** Easy to track if client follows plan

### How It Works
1. Trainer assigns workout/meal → `assigned_by_trainer: true`
2. Client logs their own → `assigned_by_trainer: false`
3. Trainer views both lists:
   - "Your Plan" (trainer-assigned)
   - "Your Logs" (client-logged)
4. Trainer can compare compliance vs. extra efforts
