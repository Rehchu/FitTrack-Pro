## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **AI Features Not Working**
   - Check `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`
   - If missing, service automatically uses rule-based fallback
   - No error - just less personalized results

2. **ExerciseDB API Errors**
   - Verify `EXERCISEDB_RAPIDAPI_KEY` is correct
   - Check RapidAPI subscription is active
   - Test in browser: https://exercisedb-api1.p.rapidapi.com/api/v1/exercises

3. **Chart Not Rendering**
   - Ensure `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2` installed
   - Check console for Chart.js registration errors
   - Verify data structure matches expected format

4. **Installer Build Fails**
   - Ensure internet connection (downloads Python)
   - Check Node.js installed (for npm build)
   - Verify PowerShell execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

5. **Email Not Sending**
   - Check SMTP credentials in `.env`
   - For Gmail: Use App Password, not account password
   - Test SMTP connection manually
